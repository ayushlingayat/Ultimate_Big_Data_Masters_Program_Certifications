## 🎓 About the Program

The **Ultimate Big Data Masters Program** is an intensive, industry‑oriented course focused on building end‑to‑end data engineering skills for production systems.[web:148][web:151]  

Key pillars of the program:

- Modern **Data Engineering fundamentals** (batch + streaming)
- **Big Data stack** – Apache Spark, Kafka, Hadoop ecosystem
- **Cloud platforms** – Azure / AWS / GCP for data workloads
- **Data Lake / Lakehouse** architectures
- **Orchestration & Scheduling** – Airflow and related tools
- **Data Warehousing & Modeling** for analytics
- **Python & SQL** for data pipelines and automation

Each week comes with focused content, hands‑on labs, and an assessment – the certificates here are the proof of completing those milestones.
